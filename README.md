This machine learning practical evaluation involves participating in a data science competition on DrivenData.org. The goal is to predict the operational status of water pumps (functional, non-functional, or needs repair) using approximately 50 variables, presenting common data challenges like missing values and high-cardinality categorical features. I will train models on provided "train" and "labels" datasets, make predictions on a "test" set, and submit their forecasts to the competition.
